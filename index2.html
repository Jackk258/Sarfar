        <p class="leader">Majestic animals and the savannah in its wildest state. Just close your eyes to glimpse the safari scenery and all the adventure atmosphere they carry. But what may be a dream, may be much closer to becoming reality than you think. CVC sells different types of packages that fit your budget.

            The most common and sought after way is safaris that are part of a complete and closed itinerary, where you don't worry about anything, with transfers, accommodation and other services.
            
            In this case, safaris are usually made in the Kruger Park and Pilanesberg parks in South Africa or in parks in Namibia, Tanzania and Kenya. The tour is done in a 4Ã—4 vehicle with a guide, along with other tourists, which makes the experience more interactive and fun.</p>
